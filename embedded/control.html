        <h2>1. Open loop, Closed Loop</h2>
        <h3>Open loop</h4>
            <li><b>Feedforward action</b>. Control action is based on knowledge to be controlled (called plant)</li>
            <li>No feedback input, only output</li>
            <li>Requires accurate model to be effective (a lot of fine tuning) </li>
            <li>Cannot compensate changes that is added to controller device</li>
            <li>Basically, No sensors. For example: Toaster</li>

            <br>
            <h3>Closed loop</h4>
                <li><b>Feedback action</b></li>
                <li>Measurements of plant output are <b>fed back</b> to the controller</li>
                <li>Generally superior performance (accuracy, bandwidth, disturbance rejection) compared to open loop
                    controlled</li>
                <li>Has tendency towards <b>instability</b></li>
                <li>Has sensors (output transducer) that measures output response</li>
                <li>Compensate changes by measuring output via sensors</li>
                <li><b>Transient response and steady state error</b> for easier control with flexibility of closed loop
                    system (by adjusting amplification)</li>
                <li>Actuating signal is when output is subtracted from input signal. If both input and output
                    transducers have unity gain(amplifies input by 1), actuating signal value is equal to actual
                    difference between input and output (error)</li>
                </br>
                <h3>There are 2 goals when designing a control system. First is achieve <b>Transient Response</b> and is
                    <b>Steady-State Response that decays to zero fast</b>

        <h2>2. Stability</h2>
        <p>Taking lift as an example</p>
        <h3>A. Transient Response</h2>
            <li>Slow transient is when changes is too slow. EG: Users grow impatient</li>
            <li>Fast transient is when changes is too fast. EG: Users feel uncomfortable. Fast transient response may
                cause physical damage to components. Fast transient comes with consequent.</li>
            <li>Sum of natural and forced but natural response is large</li>
            <br>
            <h3>B. Steady-State Response</h2>
                <li>Resembles input and is remained after transient has decayed to 0. EG: Lift reaches the floor exactly
                    at the space of lift's door</li>
                <li>Concerned about the accuracy of steady-state response (steady-state error).</li>
                <li>Sum of natural and forced but natural response is small</li>

                <h3>C. Stability</h3>
                <h4>Natural Response</h4>
                <li>The way the system dissipates or acquires energy</li>
                <li>Is dependent on system and independent of input</li>
                <li>EG: Capacitor charged to some initial voltage by an external circuit, which is disconnected awhile
                    ago</li>

                <h4>Forced Response</h4>
                <li>2 different definitions</li>
                <li>Circuit's final steady state (Agarwal&Lang, 2005)</li>
                <li>Dependent on input</li>
                <li>EG: Stop voltage as step input.</li>

                <h4>Total Response</h4>
                <p>Total Response = Transient response temporary part (natural response) + Steady-state response
                    permanent part (forced response)</p>

        <h2>3. Design Process </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Transform requirements into physicla system and specification from requirements</li>
            <li>Draw functional block diagram</li>
            <li>Transform physical system into schematic</li>
            <li>Use schematic to obtain block diagram, signal-flow diagram, or state-space representation</li>
            <li>Reduce block diagram to a single-block or closed-loop system</li>
            <li>Analyze, design and test if requirement and specification are met</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>A. Transform requirement into physical system</h3>
        <li>Desired position? Desired features? Weight? Physical dimensions?</li>
        <li>These are determined by the organizer during a robotic competition</li>
        <br>

        <h3>B. Block Diagrams</h3>
        <p> Translates from step 1 into a diagram that describes the component parts (function and/or hardware).
            It indicates the functions such as input sensors, motor drivers, controllers, hardware description, to
            produce a detailed layout of the system.</p>

        <h3>F. Analyze and Design</h3>
        <p>Physical laws such as Kirchoff's laws for electrical networks and Newton's law for mechanical system for mathamatical model development(block diagram)</p>
        <p>The steps of block making until prior to this step can be reduced if only the performance of a single subsystem is interested (EG:Only encoder and wheel)</p>
        <li>Test input signal for both analytical and during testing are used to verify the design</li>
        <li>It is important to choose simple and standarized test inputs to avoid complications</li>
        <li><b>Such inputs are impulses, steps, ramps, parabolas and sinusoids</b></li>

        <h4>Impulse input</h4>
        <li>Is infinite at t=0 and 0 everywhere else</li>
        <li>Area under the unit impulse is 1 where the approximation of this type of waveform is used to place initial energy into system so that the response due to that <b>initial energy is only a transient response of a system</b>
        <li>This response is used to <b>derive a mathematical model of the system</b></li>

        <br>
        <h4>Step input</h4>
        <li>Represents a constant command</li>
        <li>EG: position, velocity, acceleration</li>
        <li>Typically step input command is of the same form of the output</li>
